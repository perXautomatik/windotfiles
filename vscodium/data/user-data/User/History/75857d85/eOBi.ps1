.SYNOPSIS
Resolves any conflicts among the input objects and returns a new object of the same type.
.DESCRIPTION
This function takes an array of objects (tree, blob, message or metadata) and a flag (Tree, Blob, Message or Metadata) as parameters and uses git plumbing commands to resolve any conflicts among the input objects and return a new object of the same type. It uses different functions depending on the flag to merge the objects. It writes the new object as output.
.PARAMETER Objects
An array of objects (tree, blob, message or metadata) to be resolved.
.PARAMETER Flag
A flag (Tree, Blob, Message or Metadata) that indicates the type of the objects and the strategy to use for resolving them.
.EXAMPLE
ResolveConflict -Objects @("a1b2c3", "d4e5f6", "g7h8i9") -Flag Tree
Resolves any conflicts among the tree objects with SHA's "a1b2c3", "d4e5f6", and "g7h8i9" and returns a new tree object.

can you rewrite this pseudocode into a powershell script with functions with synopsis, 
with parameter validation and error checking,
USING GIT PLUMMING COMMANDS ( important, not recomended dangereus but that is what this code is supposed to do ) ;
 inside a git local repo, taken a number of commit sha's createa a new branch, create a new branch, 
 create a new commit to be head of the new branch, taking the components of the paramted commits, 
 take the objects, the tree objects, the metadata of the commit messages, 
 using a function called ResolveConflict( that does not need to be implemented by us here in this script now), 
 take the resolved object properties and createa a new commti sha, 
 with a the combined tree object of the input commits tree objects through the resolveCOnflict function, 
 and the all objects
#>
# Function to create a new branch from a number of commit SHA's
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Creates a new branch with a new commit that combines the components of the input commits.
.DESCRIPTION
This function takes an array of commit SHA's and a branch name as parameters and uses git plumbing commands to create a new branch with a new commit that combines the components of the input commits. It uses the ResolveConflict function (not implemented here) to resolve any conflicts among the tree objects, blobs, messages or metadata of the input commits. It writes the new branch name as output.
.PARAMETER Commits
An array of commit SHA's to be combined.
.PARAMETER Branch
A branch name for the new branch.
.EXAMPLE
Combine-Commits -Commits @("a1b2c3", "d4e5f6", "g7h8i9") -Branch "new-branch"
Creates a new branch called "new-branch" with a new commit that combines the components of the commits with SHA's "a1b2c3", "d4e5f6", and "g7h8i9".
