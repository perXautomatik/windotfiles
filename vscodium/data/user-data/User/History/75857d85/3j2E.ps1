# Function to resolve conflicts among tree objects in git
function ResolveConflict {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Resolves conflicts among tree objects in git.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Takes an array of tree objects as parameter and returns a new tree object that merges the changes from the input trees. The function uses git plumbing commands to manipulate the objects and resolve the conflicts.
    .PARAMETER trees
    An array of tree objects that will be used to resolve the conflicts.
    .EXAMPLE
    ResolveConflict -trees @("4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904","1234567890abcdef","fedcba0987654321")
    Returns a new tree object that merges the changes from the trees 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904, 1234567890abcdef and fedcba0987654321.

<#
can you rewrite this pseudocode into a powershell script with functions with synopsis, 
with parameter validation and error checking,
USING GIT PLUMMING COMMANDS ( important, not recomended dangereus but that is what this code is supposed to do ) ;
 inside a git local repo, taken a number of commit sha's createa a new branch, create a new branch, 
 create a new commit to be head of the new branch, taking the components of the paramted commits, 
 take the objects, the tree objects, the metadata of the commit messages, 
 using a function called ResolveConflict( that does not need to be implemented by us here in this script now), 
 take the resolved object properties and createa a new commti sha, 
 with a the combined tree object of the input commits tree objects through the resolveCOnflict function, 
 and the all objects

# Function to create a new branch from a number of commit SHA's
function createNewBranch {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Creates a new branch from a number of commit SHA's.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Takes an array of commit SHA's as parameter and creates a new branch with a new commit that combines the components of the input commits. The new commit has the resolved tree object and the concatenated commit messages of the input commits. The function uses git plumbing commands to manipulate the objects and references.
    .PARAMETER commits
    An array of commit SHA's that will be used to create the new branch.
    .PARAMETER branchName
    The name of the new branch that will be created.
    .EXAMPLE
    createNewBranch -commits @("123456","789abc","def012") -branchName "new-branch"
    Creates a new branch called "new-branch" with a new commit that combines the components of the commits 123456, 789abc and def012.
