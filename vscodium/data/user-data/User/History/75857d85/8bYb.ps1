# Function to resolve conflicts among tree objects in git
function ResolveConflict {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Resolves conflicts among tree objects in git.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Takes an array of tree objects as parameter and returns a new tree object that merges the changes from the input trees. The function uses git plumbing commands to manipulate the objects and resolve the conflicts.
    .PARAMETER trees
    An array of tree objects that will be used to resolve the conflicts.
    .EXAMPLE
    ResolveConflict -trees @("4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904","1234567890abcdef","fedcba0987654321")
    Returns a new tree object that merges the changes from the trees 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904, 1234567890abcdef and fedcba0987654321.

<#
can you rewrite this pseudocode into a powershell script with functions with synopsis, 
with parameter validation and error checking,
USING GIT PLUMMING COMMANDS ( important, not recomended dangereus but that is what this code is supposed to do ) ;
 inside a git local repo, taken a number of commit sha's createa a new branch, create a new branch, 
 create a new commit to be head of the new branch, taking the components of the paramted commits, 
 take the objects, the tree objects, the metadata of the commit messages, 
 using a function called ResolveConflict( that does not need to be implemented by us here in this script now), 
 take the resolved object properties and createa a new commti sha, 
 with a the combined tree object of the input commits tree objects through the resolveCOnflict function, 
 and the all objects
#>
# Function to create a new branch from a number of commit SHA's
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Creates a new branch with a new commit that combines the components of the input commits.
.DESCRIPTION
This function takes an array of commit SHA's and a branch name as parameters and uses git plumbing commands to create a new branch with a new commit that combines the components of the input commits. It uses the ResolveConflict function (not implemented here) to resolve any conflicts among the tree objects, blobs, messages or metadata of the input commits. It writes the new branch name as output.
.PARAMETER Commits
An array of commit SHA's to be combined.
.PARAMETER Branch
A branch name for the new branch.
.EXAMPLE
Combine-Commits -Commits @("a1b2c3", "d4e5f6", "g7h8i9") -Branch "new-branch"
Creates a new branch called "new-branch" with a new commit that combines the components of the commits with SHA's "a1b2c3", "d4e5f6", and "g7h8i9".
