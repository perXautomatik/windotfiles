# Function to create a new branch from a number of commit SHA's
function createNewBranch {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Creates a new branch from a number of commit SHA's.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Takes an array of commit SHA's as parameter and creates a new branch with a new commit that combines the components of the input commits. The new commit has the resolved tree object and the concatenated commit messages of the input commits. The function uses git plumbing commands to manipulate the objects and references.
    .PARAMETER commits
    An array of commit SHA's that will be used to create the new branch.
    .PARAMETER branchName
    The name of the new branch that will be created.
    .EXAMPLE
    createNewBranch -commits @("123456","789abc","def012") -branchName "new-branch"
    Creates a new branch called "new-branch" with a new commit that combines the components of the commits 123456, 789abc and def012.
