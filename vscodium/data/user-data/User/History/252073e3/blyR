Some more useful and popular git config settings for single developers on Windows are:

- Setting the `color.ui` option to `auto`, so that Git can use colors to highlight the output of various commands, such as `git status` or `git diff`. This can make the output more readable and easier to understand. You can use this command:

```bash
git config --global color.ui auto
```

- Setting the `core.editor` option to your preferred editor, so that you can write your commit messages and other Git operations in your favorite editor. For example, if you want to use Notepad++ as your editor, you can use this command:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"
```

- Setting the `core.excludesfile` option to a global `.gitignore` file, so that you can specify the files and directories that you want Git to ignore across all your repositories. This can save you from having to create a `.gitignore` file for each repository. You can use this command:

```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

- Setting the `push.default` option to `simple`, so that Git will only push the current branch to the remote branch that has the same name, if it exists. This can prevent accidental pushes of unwanted branches or commits. You can use this command:

```bash
git config --global push.default simple
```

- Setting the `rerere.enabled` option to `true`, so that Git can record and reuse the resolutions of merge conflicts. This can save you from having to resolve the same conflicts repeatedly when you rebase or merge branches. You can use this command:

```bash
git config --global rerere.enabled true
```
